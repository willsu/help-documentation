So you've created a ticket in Box Panel, and now you want to add an engineer that needs to see some details, how do you do that?

In the **Discussion tab**, click the "X subscribers" link (incredibly sorry it's not more obvious), as seen below:

That will bring up the **Subscribers** popup section. You can add any additional email addresses of people whom you'd like to receive notifications from ticket updates.

You can remove email addresses the same way, simply click the red "x" next to the email.
