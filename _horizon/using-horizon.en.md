**Horizon** is the web interface that is bundled with **OpenStack**. IBM Bluemix Private uses the complete open source Horizon code, thus the bundled web interface will look similar to other OpenStack interfaces that utilize the same Horizon codebase.

To get started, youâ€™ll need to log in to your OpenStack cluster account.

You should have received **admin** credentials to your private OpenStack cluster through the **Box Panel Lock Box**. Your credentials should look like this:

{% highlight bash %}
URL: https://customer_name.openstack.blueboxgrid.com
User name: Specified Username
Password: Specified Password
{% endhighlight %}

Navigate to the specified URL. Use the specified user name and password to log in. You should see the following screen:

Welcome to Horizon.
