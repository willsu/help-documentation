Navigate through the following tabs and provide the values, then click **Launch Instance** on the lower right side of the dialog box.

### Fill in values in the Launch Instance dialog box

#### The Details tab

| **Values**           | **Description** 																																																					 | 
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Instance Name        | Assign a name to your virtual machine. The name that you assign here becomes the initial host name of the server. Server names are not guaranteed to be unique when created, thus you could have two instances with the same host name. |
| Availability Zone    | By default, this value is set to the Availability Zone (AZ) given by the cloud provider, for example, `compute_standard`. 																												 |
| Count	               | To launch multiple instances, enter a value greater than 1. The default is 1.																																																																															  |

**Note:** The **Image** option is set by default, so you don't have to select one before booting. If you use the **Image** option, you can select from the public images provided by IBM, or you can upload and use your own image. For information about how to upload an image to IBM Bluemix Private Cloud, see [Cloud images provided by IBM Bluemix Private Cloud](http://ibm-blue-box-help.github.io/help-documentation/gettingstarted/userguides/Cloud_Images_Provided_by_IBM/). 

#### The Flavor tab

Make a selection from the list of flavors, then click the plus sign (+) to move it to **Allocated**. 

![The Flavor tab]({{site.baseurl}}/img/newton_launch_instance_flavor.PNG)

#### The Networks tab

Make a selection from the list of networks, then click the plus sign (+) to move it to **Allocated**. You can allocate multiple networks to the instance. 

![The Flavor tab]({{site.baseurl}}/img/newton_launch_instance_network.png)

#### The Network Ports tab

If you do not specify any network port, a default one is assigned to the instance when the instance is created and booted.

Occasionally, you may need to create ports beforehand through APIs. After you create a port and associate it with one of the networks that you've selected in the
 **Networks** tab, you'll be able to view this port in the **Available** table. You can click the plus sign (+) to move it to **Allocated**.     

![The Flavor tab]({{site.baseurl}}/img/launch_instance_port.png)

#### The Security Groups tab

Make a selection from the list of security groups, then click the plus sign (+) to move it to **Allocated**.   

![The Security Group tab]({{site.baseurl}}/img/newton_launch_instance_srg.png)        

			
#### The Key Pair tab

Specify a key pair. You have the following options:

* Select from a list of stored key pairs, then click the plus sign (+) to move your selection to **Allocated**.   
* Click **Import Key Pair** to import your own key pair. Copy and paste your public key, then click **Import Key Pair**.
* Click **Create Key Pair** to create and store a new key pair. Specify the key pair name, then click **Create Key Pair**.  
  
  ![Create a new key pair]({{site.baseurl}}/img/launch_instance_kp.PNG)
  
  You'll be promoted to save the new key pair to the local host.
  
  ![Create a new key pair and save]({{site.baseurl}}/img/newton_launch_instance_kp_new.PNG)

#### The Configuration tab

Custom scripts attached to instances can perform specific actions when the instance is launched. You can type your script directly into the **Customization Script** field. 
	
**For Linux instances:** The default username is `ibmcloud`. To enable password authentication through console and SSH, use the following script data for the Customization Script (substitute the relevant _password_ in place of `<YOUR_PASSWORD>`):

	#cloud-config password: <YOUR_PASSWORD> chpasswd: { expire: False } ssh_pwauth: True

**For Windows instances:** To set up your initial username and password, use the following script data for the Customization Script (substitute the relevant _username_ and _password_ in place of `<YOUR_USERNAME>` and `<YOUR_PASSWORD>`).

	rem cmd
	net user <YOUR_USERNAME> <YOUR_PASSWORD> /logonpasswordchg:yes /add /y
	net localgroup administrators <YOUR_USERNAME> /add
	
![Custom script]({{site.baseurl}}/img/newton_launch_instance_script.PNG)

If your browser supports the **HTML5 File API**, you may click **Browse** to load your script from a file. The size of your script should not exceed **16 Kb**.

In the **Disk Partition** drop-down menu, you can select **Automatic** to resize the disk and set it to a single partition, or you can select **Manual** to create multiple partitions on the disk.

Select the **Configuration Drive** checkbox if you want to write metadata to a special configuration drive, then specify your metadata in the **Metadata** tab. When the instance boots, it attaches to the configuration drive for access to your metadata.


#### The Server Groups tab

Server groups can be used to control the affinity and anti-affinity scheduling policy for a group of servers (instances).

Occasionally, you may need to create server groups beforehand through APIs. After you create a server group you'll be able to view this server group in the **Available** table. You can click the plus sign (+) to move it to **Allocated**. 

![Server Groups]({{site.baseurl}}/img/newton_launch_instance_servergroup.png)    


#### The Scheduler Hints tab

The scheduler hints can be used to pass additional placement related information to the Nova scheduler. For example, you can use a scheduler hint to ensure that an instance is scheduled on to a host from a certain server group. You can also construct a custom scheduler hint in JSON format. For more details about the scheduling mechanism and the supported hint types, see [Compute Schedulers](https://docs.openstack.org/newton/config-reference/compute/schedulers.html).

#### The Metadata tab

Glance provides a common API to define key and value pairs that tag metadata for different types of resources (images, artifacts, volumes, flavors, aggregates, and so on). If the image that you select contains pre-defined metadata, you'll see that in the **Available metadata** column. 

You can create additional key and value pairs in the **Custom** field and click the plus sign (+) to move them to the **Existing metadata** list. For example, custom metadata is a parameter that you'd want to pass to the application, so it can be installed with the instance.

![Custom meta]({{site.baseurl}}/img/newton_launch_instance_meta.PNG)

For more information about Glance metadata, see [Metadata Definition Concepts](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/glance/metadefs-concepts.html) and [Using Glance’s Metadata Definitions Catalog Public APIs](http://docs.openstack.org/developer/glance/glancemetadefcatalogapi.html).

## How to connect to your instance

**Note:** Be sure that proper security group rules are defined for connecting to your instance over `ssh` or `rdp`.

1. Log into the IBM Bluemix Private Cloud Horizon dashboard.

2. Expand the **Project** panel, then the **Compute** tab in the left navigation area, and click on **Instances**.

3. Locate your instance in the list of running instances and note its IP address, such as `192.168.100.237`.

4. Create a connection to your instance by specifying its IP address.

### Connecting to Linux instances
  
Connect to your instance through SSH or VNC. The default `userid` for the Linux images provided by IBM is **ibmcloud**. Once you've connected to your Linux instance, you can use the `sudo` command to execute commands that normally require root access. Sudo is configured not to require a password for the default `userid`.

* Using your favorite SSH client, open a connection to the correct IP address of the VM instance, employing the private SSH key of the keypair that you specified during provisioning:
	 
	```  
	ssh -i <path_of_Your_SSH_private_key_file> <userid>@<ip_of_instance>
	```
	
* From the IBM Bluemix Private Cloud Horizon dashboard, view the VNC console of the instance by clicking **Console** from the drop-down list in the **Actions** column of the instance. The VNC console connects you with HTTPS.
  
**Note:** To log in to a new Linux instance, via the console, as `ibmcloud` user, you must have specified a password previously, in the Customization Script during provisioning.
  
### Connecting to Windows instances

Connect to your instance through Remote Desktop or VNC. You'll need to use the `userid` and `password` you specified in the Customization Script during VM provisioning. On your first login, a prompt appears, requesting that you change your password. Please do.

* Use your favorite Remote Desktop client to connect.
* From the IBM Bluemix Private Cloud Horizon dashboard, view the VNC console of the instance by clicking **Console** from the drop-down list in the **Actions** column of the instance. The VNC console connects you with HTTPS.
