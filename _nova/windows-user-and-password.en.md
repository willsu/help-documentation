To set the initial username and password, use the following command (with the relevant username and password in place of `<USERNAME>` and `<YOUR_PASSWORD>`). 

{% highlight bash %}
rem cmd
net user <USERNAME> <YOUR_PASSWORD> /logonpasswordchg:yes /add /y
net localgroup administrators <USERNAME> /add
{% endhighlight %}

Put that command in the user data (that is, under the **Post-Creation** tab in **Horizon**) and it will be run by `cloud-init`.
