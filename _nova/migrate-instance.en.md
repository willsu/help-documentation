Occasionally, due to upgrades, data center moves or other unforeseen events, it becomes necessary to migrate your instances from one OpenStack cloud to another.

In this example, we're going to take a snapshot of an instance (a simple one just running nginx), download it to our local machine and then upload it back up to the new cloud. First, let's take a look at our instance.

{% highlight bash %}
ubuntu@snap-test:~$ ps aux | grep nginx
root      1432  0.0  0.2  85880  1336 ?        Ss   01:39   0:00 nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx
www-data  1433  0.0  0.3  86220  1760 ?        S    01:39   0:00 nginx: worker process
www-data  1434  0.0  0.3  86220  1760 ?        S    01:39   0:00 nginx: worker process
www-data  1435  0.0  0.3  86220  1760 ?        S    01:39   0:00 nginx: worker process
www-data  1436  0.0  0.4  86220  2248 ?        S    01:39   0:00 nginx: worker process
ubuntu    1452  0.0  0.1  10460   916 pts/0    S+   01:43   0:00 grep --color=auto nginx
{% endhighlight %}

We can see that `nginx` is running from inside the instance; let's check out the instance itself.
(**Note**: I have named the instance `snap_test`, so I can `grep` for it specifically):

{% highlight bash %}
$ nova list | grep snap
| ed1b1588-8117-4ea8-ab60-1d5a94b8904f | snap_test                    | ACTIVE  | -          | Running     | internal=10.230.16.214, 173.247.106.18 |
{% endhighlight %}

From here we can see the external IP of the instance; let's visit it to make sure `nginx` is up and running:

![Running Instance]({{site.baseurl}}/img/Running_Instance.png)


So now that we know it's up and running, let's get it moved over to our new cloud.

First, a note about sourcing. You'll need to have sourced the credentials of your existing cloud to run the cloud commands necessary to run the snapshotting and moving. In this case, I have installed [`python-openstackclient`](https://github.com/openstack/python-openstackclient) on my Mac and grabbed the `stackrc` from my cloud, by clicking on **Download OpenStack RC File** on the right, as this image shows:

![Click on Download OpenStack RC File]({{site.baseurl}}/img/Download_RC_File.png)

Make sure you source your `stackrc`:

{% highlight bash %}
$ source your_stackrc
{% endhighlight %}

That done, let's snapshot our instance. We know its instance ID from the previous **Nova** command, so let's just do it:

{% highlight bash %}
$ nova image-create ed1b1588-8117-4ea8-ab60-1d5a94b8904f snap_migrate
{% endhighlight %}

You can follow along in **Horizon** if you like; you should see the **Task** of your instance change to snapshotting and then uploading. After that, you should be able to see your snapshot in the `image-list`:

{% highlight bash %}
$ nova image-list | grep snap_migrate
| b8f4d8cd-0c3c-4c5b-9011-5740f7ea3a53 | snap_migrate                      | ACTIVE | ed1b1588-8117-4ea8-ab60-1d5a94b8904f |
{% endhighlight %}

Once it's done (and it may take a bit, depending on the image size) and the image shows as **ACTIVE**, go ahead and download it to your local machine:


{% highlight bash %}
$ glance image-download b8f4d8cd-0c3c-4c5b-9011-5740f7ea3a53 --file snap_migrate.img
{% endhighlight %}

Once that download completes, you now have the image saved locally. Let's turn around and immediately upload it into our new cloud. First, make sure to source the `stackrc` from that cloud to make sure you're interacting with the right one, then go ahead and upload the snapshot you created:

{% highlight bash %}
$ glance image-create --container-format bare --disk-format qcow2 --name snap_migration --file snap_migrate.img

{% endhighlight %}

A note about the `image-create` command when you use **Glance**. In the previous command, here's what we did:

`--container-format:` Container format of image. Acceptable formats: `ami`,
`ari`, `aki`, `bare`, and `ovf`.

`--disk-format:` Disk format of image. Acceptable formats: `ami`, `ari`,
`aki`, `vhd`, `vmdk`, `raw`, `qcow2`, `vdi`, and `iso`. (Note that OpenStack uses `qcow2` for all images internally.)

`--name` Name of your image.

`--file` Local file that contains a disk image to be uploaded
during creation. Alternatively, images can be passed
to the client via `stdin`.

When that completes, let's boot an instance from the snapshot:

{% highlight bash %}
$ nova boot --image snap_migration --nic net-id=ba0fdd03-72b5-41eb-bb67-fef437fd6cb4 --security-groups jksec --flavor m1.tiny snap_migration_test

In the previous command (`nova boot --image snap_migration --nic net-id=ba0fdd03-72b5-41eb-bb67-fef437fd6cb4 --security-groups jksec --flavor m1.tiny snap_migration_test`) I used the `--nic net-id` that I gained by running `nova net-list` and grabbing the ID of the internal network. Likewise, the `--security-groups` variable `jksec` came from running `nova secgroup-list`, both commands being run using the API. You can find both commands in the **Horizon** panel as well.

Once our instance comes up, we need to give it an external IP in order for `nginx` to be able to be reached from the outside. Speaking of which, make sure to allow `port 80` ingress on your new cloud security group so your instance is reachable that way.

{% highlight bash %}
$ nova add-floating-ip 9d006877-4e8a-499a-85e3-0aeb247030d9 173.247.105.119
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, let's test our moved instance to make sure `nginx` is up and running without issue (remember, we haven't even logged into the instance, this is a drag and drop procedure thus far):

That's it! Thanks!
