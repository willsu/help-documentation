OpenStack has numerous quotas, and when you hit one of these quotas, it doesn't always notify you clearly.  Not every quota is exposed in the **Horizon** user interface.  This article explains what quotas you may hit, what happens when you hit them, and how to modify them.

### Introduction

You have an overall quota, which cannot be exceeded by the individual quotas you'll set for each project you're running within your cloud. The quotas you set depend on how many projects you have and how you want to distribute your resources among those projects. They're really up to you. If you only foresee making one project, you could allocate all available resources to that project and leave it like that.

Here is an example of a capacity report for CPU, RAM, and Disk. You can use the # total numbers (shown in output like this one) to help guide the numbers you use for your quotas. The actual limits of the system are those Total (#) numbers below the line. The one exception in this example is the CPU, which is overcommitted 2x.

```
(+) Overcommit Ratio   (%) Percent Used   (#) Total   (-) Used   (=) Available

Hypervisor                 CPU+  MEM%  DSK%  CPU# CPU- MEM#     MEM-     MEM=     DSK#   DSK-   DSK=
ds0.dal.bluebox.com        0.000 0.032 0.000 28   0    128828   4096     124732   723    0      723
ds11.dal.bluebox.com       0.000 0.032 0.000 28   0    128828   4096     124732   723    0      723
ds2.dal.bluebox.com        0.161 0.083 0.091 31   5    128828   10752    118076   989    90     899
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                      0.057 0.049 0.037 87   5    386484   18944    367540   2435   90     2345
```

### Other limits you may encounter:

**Floating IPs:** Please see [http://ibm-blue-box-help.github.io/help-documentation/neutron/network_ip_availability/](http://ibm-blue-box-help.github.io/help-documentation/neutron/network_ip_availability/)

**Security Groups:** Most customers go with the default limit and adjust upwards as needed. This keeps firewall rules to a manageable level, so as to not impact performance. At a certain point (we haven't seen what particular point this is yet), it is theoretically possible to end up with too many firewall rules and not enough CPU to process them quickly enough. The default limits may seem low, but they're more than enough for most people, who will never create more than a few security groups, with maybe half a dozen rules each.

**Instances:** Most customers go with the default limit and adjust upwards as needed. With enough hardware, you can get into hundreds of thousands of instances. For your particular hardware, you need to make your own calculations based on your desired resource consumption for each VM.

**Maximum Number of Host Routes per Subnet:** There is not (yet) a user-adjustable quota in Neutron that controls this. There is a hard limit in neutron.conf (`max_subnet_host_routes`) that specifies a maximum number of host routes per subnet, and the default is 20.

**Maximum Number of Volumes per Virtual Machine:** There is no quota for this, but there is a hard-coded limit of 26.  This manifests when you try to attach a another new volume via the command line and receive the error "No free disk device names for prefix 'vd'". You can view this hard-coded limit at https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/libvirt/blockinfo.py#L162  You can run `lspci` inside your VM to see all of the devices attached to the PCI bus in your VM.  (The PCI bus itself is limited to 32 devices with KVM.)

### Neutron vs. Nova Rule Precedence

There is some overlap between the quotas enforced by the Nova and Neutron services. In the event of a conflict, Neutron quotas always take precedence.

If you need to update security group rules, for instance, take note, there are three places you may need to make the update:

In Neutron: `neutron quota-update --security-group-rule 250 <project-ID>`

In Nova: 

 * For the project: `nova quota-update --security-group-rules 250 <project-ID>`

 * And potentially for the user: `nova quota-show --user <username> --tenant <project-ID>`


## Common Questions

The remaining sections of this document offer more detail about commons questions and errors you may encounter.

## Common Quota Error Messages

The exact error you get depends on what interface you're using, the version of your command line client, and the cluster stack version.  Here are some examples of what you might see:

From Horizon:

{% highlight bash %}
ERROR (ClientException): The server has either erred or is incapable of performing the requested operation. (HTTP 500) (Request-ID: req-12276a72-b97f-4b41-9a86-12f32d9db5ec)
{% endhighlight %}

From the Neutron command-line client:

{% highlight bash %}
Conflict (HTTP 409)
{% endhighlight %}

From the log:
{% highlight bash %}
TRACE neutron.api.v2.resource OverQuota: Quota exceeded for resources: ['security_group_rule']
{% endhighlight %}


## Most Commonly Hit Quotas

The most commonly hit is **Number of Instances Allowed Per Tenant** - (**Nova Compute**) - The default is 10.  Read on to find out how to update this number.


# Compute Quotas

## How to list the Default Compute Quotas

List all default quotas for all tenants, as follows:

{% highlight bash %}
$ nova quota-defaults
{% endhighlight %}

For example:

{% highlight bash %}
$ nova quota-defaults
+-----------------------------+-------+
| Quota                       | Limit |
+-----------------------------+-------+
| instances                   | 10    |
| cores                       | 20    |
| ram                         | 51200 |
| floating_ips                | 10    |
| fixed_ips                   | -1    |
| metadata_items              | 128   |
| injected_files              | 5     |
| injected_file_content_bytes | 10240 |
| injected_file_path_bytes    | 255   |
| key_pairs                   | 100   |
| security_groups             | 10    |
| security_group_rules        | 20    |
+-----------------------------+-------+
{% endhighlight %}

Update a default value for a new tenant, as follows:

{% highlight bash %}
$ nova quota-class-update --key value default
{% endhighlight %}

For example:

{% highlight bash %}
$ nova quota-class-update --instances 15 default
{% endhighlight %}

## How to view Tenant Compute Quotas

Place the tenant ID in a useable variable, as follows:

{% highlight bash %}
$ tenant=$(keystone tenant-list | awk '/tenantName/ {print $2}')
{% endhighlight %}

List the currently set quota values for a tenant, as follows:

{% highlight bash %}
$ nova quota-show --tenant $tenant
{% endhighlight %}

For example:

{% highlight bash %}
$ nova quota-show --tenant $tenant
+-----------------------------+-------+
| Quota                       | Limit |
+-----------------------------+-------+
| instances                   | 10    |
| cores                       | 20    |
| ram                         | 51200 |
| floating_ips                | 10    |
| fixed_ips                   | -1    |
| metadata_items              | 128   |
| injected_files              | 5     |
| injected_file_content_bytes | 10240 |
| injected_file_path_bytes    | 255   |
| key_pairs                   | 100   |
| security_groups             | 10    |
| security_group_rules        | 20    |
+-----------------------------+-------+
{% endhighlight %}


## How to update Tenant Compute Quotas

Obtain the tenant ID, as follows:

{% highlight bash %}
$ tenant=$(keystone tenant-list | awk '/tenantName/ {print $2}')
{% endhighlight %}

Update a particular quota value, as follows:

{% highlight bash %}
# nova quota-update --quotaName quotaValue tenantID
{% endhighlight %}

For example:

{% highlight bash %}
# nova quota-update --floating-ips 20 $tenant
# nova quota-show --tenant $tenant
+-----------------------------+-------+
| Quota                       | Limit |
+-----------------------------+-------+
| instances                   | 10    |
| cores                       | 20    |
| ram                         | 51200 |
| floating_ips                | 20    |
| fixed_ips                   | -1    |
| metadata_items              | 128   |
| injected_files              | 5     |
| injected_file_content_bytes | 10240 |
| injected_file_path_bytes    | 255   |
| key_pairs                   | 100   |
| security_groups             | 10    |
| security_group_rules        | 20    |
+-----------------------------+-------+
{% endhighlight %}

# Network Quotas

## How to list Tenant Network Quotas

{% highlight bash %}
# neutron quota-show --tenant-id <tenant-id>
{% endhighlight %}

For example:

{% highlight bash %}
# neutron quota-show
+-----------------------------+-------+
| Field                       | Value |
+-----------------------------+-------+
| floatingip                  | 50    |
| network                     | 10    |

| subnet                      | 10    |
+-----------------------------+-------+
{% endhighlight %}

## How to update Tenant Network Quotas

{% highlight bash %}
# neutron quota-update --tenant-id <tenant-id> --<resource> <limit>
{% endhighlight %}

If Neutron LBaaS is enabled in your cluster, you may encounter a problem that the quota of `loadbalancer` can't be updated via above command when you are using `python-neutronclient` of version < `6.0.0` (there won't be any error from the command, but the quota limit will be unchanged), that is a bug in older version of `python-neutronclient` and had been fixed in version `6.0.0` and higher. Please upgrade your `python-neutronclient` or use the following command as a workaround solution for `python-neutronclient` of version < `6.0.0`.

{% highlight bash %}
# neutron quota-update <tenant-id> --loadbalancer <limit>
{% endhighlight %}

# Storage Quotas

## How to list Cinder Quotas

{% highlight bash %}
# cinder quota-show tenant01
+-----------+-------+
|  Property | Value |
+-----------+-------+
| gigabytes |  1000 |
| snapshots |   10  |
|  volumes  |   10  |
+-----------+-------+
{% endhighlight %}

## How to see current Cinder Storage usage

{% highlight bash %}
# cinder absolute-limits | grep Used
| totalBackupGigabytesUsed |    0  |
| totalBackupsUsed         |    0  |
|  totalGigabytesUsed      |   82  |
| totalSnapshotsUsed       |    0  |
|  totalVolumesUsed        |    4  |
{% endhighlight %}

## How to update Cinder Quotas

Update a particular quota value, as follows:
Known Limitation: When updating or viewing quota values corresponding to a tenant or project, always use ID of the project instead of its Name. Otherwise you might see inconsitent values.

{% highlight bash %}
# tenant=$(openstack project list | awk '/tenantName/ {print $2}')
# cinder quota-update --quotaName NewValue tenantID
{% endhighlight %}

For example:
{% highlight bash %}
# cinder quota-update --volumes 15 $tenant
# cinder quota-show $tenant
+-----------+-------+
|  Property | Value |
+-----------+-------+
| gigabytes |  1000 |
| snapshots |   10  |
|  volumes  |   15  |
+-----------+-------+
 {% endhighlight %}
