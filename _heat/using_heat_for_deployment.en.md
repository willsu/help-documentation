Heat resource types such as `OS::Heat::SoftwareDeployment` call back to Heat during stack creation. In an environment with a certificate signed by a Certificate Authority, Heat tools such as `os-collect-config` can be used. But in an environment with any self-signed certificate, these tools might fail with the `error _ssl.c:510:`

	error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate.


### How to resolve this issue

This proposed resolution covers the following resource types:

* Stack with `OS::Heat::SoftwareDeployment`
* Stack with `OS::Nova::Server` and the `user_data_format: SOFTWARE_CONFIG` setting

Take these steps:

1. Use the following command to download the IBM Bluemix Private Cloud certificate into a `crt` file, for example, `example.crt` (replace `example.blueboxcloud.com` with your own FQDN):
    
		echo -n | openssl s_client -connect  example.blueboxcloud.com:5000 | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p'  > example.crt

   
   **Note:** The certificate file for Heat and Keystone are the same at present. If they are not the same, copy them to `cacert.pem` separately.   

2. Copy the content of `example.crt` to `cacert.pem` using either of the following options (against image or against VM). You have two options: 

**Option 1:** Copy the contents of `example.crt` to the `cacert.pem` files in the image, register the image to OpenStack, and use it in the Heat template:

{% highlight bash %}
cat example.crt >> /opt/stack/venvs/os-collect-config/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/cacert.pem
cat example.crt >> /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/cacert.pem
cat example.crt >> /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
{% endhighlight %}

**Option 2:** Use `user_data` in `OS::Nova::Server` to copy the contents of `example.crt` to `cacert.pem` files. The detailed steps are described as follows: 


1. Use the following commands:

		user_data:
		get_file: <your_path>/importCAcert.sh

2. In the contents of `importCAcert.sh` file, replace the certificate with your own:

		#!/bin/sh
        echo "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        certificate contents
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----" >/tmp/example.crt

3. Use the following commands to copy the contents of `example.crt` to `cacert.pem` files:

		cat /tmp/example.crt >> /opt/stack/venvs/os-collect-config/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/cacert.pem
		cat /tmp/example.crt >> /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/cacert.pem
		cat /tmp/example.crt >> /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
