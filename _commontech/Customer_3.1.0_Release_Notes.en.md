## Release Notes 3.1.0

#### October 14, 2016


This document offers a basic description of the 3.1.0 IBM Bluemix Private Cloud and IBM Bluemix Private Cloud Local offerings. Links to further documentation can be found in each section.

### Summary of the Latest Release

Release 3.1.0 of **IBM Bluemix Private Cloud** and **IBM Bluemix Private Cloud Local** , includes some new capabilities and performance improvements. It is still based on the OpenStack Mitaka release.

**Every IBM Bluemix Private Cloud has these new features in 3.1.0:**

1.) **Federated Keystoneâ€“Customer Identity Provider (IdP)**: Customers now can utilize their existing Identity Infrastructure federation protocols, such as Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) or OpenIDConnect, to use the identities stored in their own identity directories (such as LDAP, RADIUS, and Active Directory). A single, customer-managed credential can be used to manage multiple OpenStack clouds.

 * [SAML Federation](http://ibm-blue-box-help.github.io/help-documentation/keystone/saml-federation/)
 * [OIDC Federation](http://ibm-blue-box-help.github.io/help-documentation/keystone/oidc-federation/)       

2.) **Storage Pools**: Customers with diverse storage performance requirements can now direct workloads optimally, to high-performance SSD and cost-effective Hybrid storage pools in the same cloud. The minimum number of OSD nodes for a new deployment remains at 3, and for hybrid expansion a minumum of 3 nodes must be added. After that, you may expand your storage one node at a time.
